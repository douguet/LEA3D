# LEA3D
Computer-Aided Molecular Design

**LEA3D** is a de novo design software which allows to optimize the structure of molecules. It is based on the publications [LEA3D: A Computer-Aided Ligand Design for Structure-Based Drug Design](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/jm0492296);  [e-LEA3D: a computational-aided drug design web server](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/jm0492296)
