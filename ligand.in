#	Parameters of the Genetic Algorithm

# The maximun number of generations
GENMAX	50

# The number of molecules in the population
POP	40

# The maximum number of fragments a molecule may combine
# analysis on e-Drug3D_1822 reports that synthetic drug is composed by 5.4 fragments 
# LONGGEN=0 means that there is no constraints (but 10 fragments is still the default maximum)
#LONGGEN 6
LONGGEN	0

# Elitism strategy (set the number of parent molecules (the best) 
# you want to copy to the new generation without alteration) 
ELITISM	1

#	Fitness Function
#############################################

# Name of the fitness function definition file
FUNCTION ligand.func


# Option to convert function evaluation into filtering step
# if > 0 then means that only molecules possessing score >= SCORE100 % are kept (range[1-100])
SCORE100 0


# Specify the optimization ligand.in (0 or 1)
OPTIMIS 1

# Specify the maximum number of conformers 
NBCONF 1


# Specify the calculation of charges by using ANTECHAMBER
# used in properties calculation only (dipole)
# either by the Gasteiger method 'GAS' (Gasteiger and Marsili, 
# Tetrahedron, 36, 3219-3288) or 
# or by AM1-BCC method 'AM1' (Jakalian et al., J. Comp. Chem., 2000, 21, 132-146)
# '0' means no charge calculation required

#CHARGES 1 AM1
CHARGES 0 
#CHARGES 1 GAS


# FILTER acts as the command "drug"
# if you want to skip this step:
FILTER 0
# Following command keep all molecules except if not 3D converted and then ionize them
#FILTER   P  3D  -  -  T  -  I 0


#A SCAFFOLD can be imposed either in de novo drug design (lea) or to create a combinatorial 
#library (lea -r). In the last case, the combinatorial library generator will connect the scaffold
#to each molecule in GET_POOL.
#There are 2 ways to indicate the atom(s) to connect:
#1) in the scaffold sdf file, modify the hydrogen(s) element name 'H' that can be replaced by a 
#fragment by a 'X' dummy atom.
#2) or indicate on the same line the atom number where lies the substitution. In the following case 
#'SCAFFOLD building_block.sdf 5 1', the atoms 5 and 1 can be substituted.
#Note that the atom no 5 must be a heavy atom connected to a hydrogen. The hydrogen will be 
#replaced by a fragment.
#in default case, no scaffold:
SCAFFOLD 0
#SCAFFOLD building_block.sdf
#SCAFFOLD test.sdf 5 1

#To create a combinatorial library (lea -r), a reactant library must be set
#GET_POOL is a sdf file that contains molecules, each with only 1 'X' dummy atom that indicates
#the connection site
#in default case, no GET_POOL:
GET_POOL  0
#GET_POOL reactants.sdf

#Starting pool: a file with a molecule / line using the same format as a molecule in LEA3D 
#(eg: 1*5-3*4_3*1-2*6_2*3-4*1 / 1 2 3 4 ). File example: stemdrug.txt in LEGO dir
#Importantly: legos must be consistent with the current uploaded library and in the right ORDER
#(Currently: all.sdf)
#popopop.txt contains the last population of a LEA3D run
#useful to begin with existing drugs to derive them in new ones (stemdrug.txt)
START 0
#START stemdrug.txt
#START popopop.txt

# Output comments 0-3 (but 0 is recommended)
