#	Parameters of the Genetic Algorithm

# The maximun number of generations
GENMAX	50

# The number of molecules in the population
POP	40

# The maximum number of fragments a molecule may combine
# analysis of the e-Drug3D_1822 content showed that, on average, a synthetic drug is composed of 5 fragments 
# LONGGEN=0 means that there is no constraints (but 10 fragments is still the default maximum)
#LONGGEN 6
LONGGEN	0

# Elitism strategy (set the number of parent molecules (the best) 
# you want to copy to the new generation without alteration) 
ELITISM	1

#	Fitness Function
#############################################

# Name of the fitness function definition file
FUNCTION ligand.func

# Option to convert the fitness function evaluation into a filtering step
# if > 0 then it means that only molecules possessing score >= SCORE100 % are kept (range[1-100])
SCORE100 0

# Specify the conformer optimization of molecules (0 (no) or 1 (yes))
OPTIMIS 1

# Specify the maximum number of conformers if OPTIMIS is set to 1
NBCONF 1

# ***** NOT available in the LEA3D core version of LEA3D *****
# Specify the calculation of charges by using ANTECHAMBER (the software AMBER must be installed)
# used in properties calculation only (dipole)
# either by the Gasteiger method 'GAS' (Gasteiger and Marsili, 
# Tetrahedron, 36, 3219-3288) or 
# or by AM1-BCC method 'AM1' (Jakalian et al., J. Comp. Chem., 2000, 21, 132-146)
# '0' means no charge calculation required
#CHARGES 1 GAS
#CHARGES 1 AM1
#in default case, it is not activated:
CHARGES 0 

# ***** NOT available in the LEA3D core version of LEA3D *****
# FILTER acts as the command "drug" (filter out molecules that are not druglike)
# if you want to skip this step:
# Following command keep all molecules except if not 3D converted and then ionize them
#FILTER   P  3D  -  -  T  -  I 0
#in default case, it is not activated:
FILTER 0

#A SCAFFOLD can be imposed either in de novo molecular design (lea3d) or to create a combinatorial
#library (lea -r). In the last case, the combinatorial library generator will connect the scaffold
#to each molecule in GET_POOL.
#There are 2 ways to indicate the atom(s) to connect:
#1) in the scaffold sdf file, modify the hydrogen(s) element name 'H' that must be replaced by a
#fragment by a 'X' dummy atom.
#2) or indicate on the line the atom number on which the substitution must be done. For example, 
#in the following case 'SCAFFOLD building_block.sdf 5 1', the atoms 5 and 1 can both be linked to a new substituent.
#Note that the atom number 5 must be a heavy atom connected to a hydrogen (or 'X'). The hydrogen will be 
#replaced by the fragment.
#Here, building_block.sdf must contain a 'X' dummy atom:
#SCAFFOLD building_block.sdf
#Here, atom 5 or 1 will be linked to a new fragment
#SCAFFOLD test.sdf 5 1
#in default case, no scaffold:
SCAFFOLD 0

# ***** NOT described further in the Manual of LEA3D core *****
# To create a combinatorial library (lea -r), a reactant library must be set
#GET_POOL is a sdf file that contains molecules, each with only 1 'X' dummy atom that indicates
#the connection site. For example:
#GET_POOL reactants.sdf
#in default case, no GET_POOL:
GET_POOL  0

#Starting pool: a file with a molecule / line using the same format as a molecule in LEA3D 
#eg: 1*5-3*4_3*1-2*6_2*3-4*1 / 1 2 913 1206 as in the file list_mol_sulfapyridine_aspirin_venetoclax in the folder "examples" 
#Importantly: legos must be consistent with the current uploaded library and in the right ORDER
#(Currently: all.sdf in LEGO directory)
#This option is useful to begin with user-defined molecules to derive them in new ones
#START list_mol_sulfapyridine_aspirin_venetoclax
#START popopop.txt
#in default case, it is not activated:
START 0

# Output comments 0-3 (but 0 is recommended)
VERBOSITY 0
